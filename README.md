A plugin with the main goal of creating a parallelogram within the tablet area - all points within this parallelogram should get converted to tablet area coordinates.

The parallelogram has flat bottom and top edges, and the Y-axis is rotated by an angle SkewYAngle.

Currently usable, but there's some math errors so the angle you input is different from what you get.
